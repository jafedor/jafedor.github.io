<h1>Hello!</h1>

<p>Since the Animation Player I created in June 2020 was for my Object-Oriented Design class at Northeastern, the code must be kept private due to the academic honesty policy (basically, we're not allowed to publish our code from this class because students currently taking OOD might find it).</p> 

<p>If you would like to view the source code of my Animation Player application, feel free to send me an email @jessica9295@comcast.net or call me at (413)372-2208 and I will happily give you access.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Jessica Fedor</p>
