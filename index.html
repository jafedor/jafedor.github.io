  <h4>You are probably looking for the Animation Player or SMS Texting Bot I mention on my resume.</h4>
  
  <p>Unfortunately, because the SMS application I worked on is owned by the organization I was interning at (Suffield Academy), I do not have permission to pushlish that project. However, you can still view the Animation Player, although it is currently private.</p>

  <p>Since the Animation Player I created in June 2020 was for my Object-Oriented Design class at Northeastern University, the code must be kept private due to the academic honesty policy. Basically, students are not allowed to publish their code from this class because students currently taking this course might find it.</p> 

  <p>If you would like to view the source code or download the .jar file of my Animation Player application, please don't hesitate to send me an email at <b>jessica9295@comcast.net</b> or call me at <b>(413)372-2208</b> and I will happily give you access to the GitHub repository.</p>

  <p style="text-align:center;">Thanks!</p>
