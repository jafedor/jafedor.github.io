<h1 style="text-align:center;">Hello!</h1>
  <h4>Thanks for visiting my humble website! You are probably looking for the coding projects I mention on my resume/<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-fedor">LinkedIn</a>.</h4>
    
  <p>Click here to see my <a href="https://github.com/jafedor/OrderDataAnalysis">Python Excel Spreadsheet Analyzer</a> project on GitHub!</p>
  
  <br>
  
  <h4>Now, about those other projects...</h4>
  
  <p>I created the Python JSON Data Analyzer script as I was writing the answer to a complex practice coding assessment. Because of this, I was advised against posting it publicly.</p>
  
  <p>Unfortunately, because the SMS Texting Bot I worked on is owned by the organization I was interning at (Suffield Academy), I do not have permission to publish that project.</p>

  <p>Lastly, since the Animation Player I created in June 2020 was for my Object-Oriented Design class at Northeastern University, the code must be kept private due to the academic honesty policy. Basically, students are not allowed to publish their code from this class because students currently taking this course might find it.</p> 

  <h4>However!</h4>
  
  <p>If you would like to view the source code of my <b>Python JSON Data Analyzer</b> or <b>Animation Player application</b>, please don't hesitate to send me an email at <b>jessica9295@comcast.net</b> or call me at <b>(413)372-2208</b> and I will happily give you access to their GitHub repositories. Please note that I no longer have access to the repository for the SMS Texting Bot.</p>

  <p style="text-align:center;">Thanks!</p>
